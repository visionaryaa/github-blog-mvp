# Welcome to My GitHub-Powered Blog!

This is a sample post for the GitHub-powered blog built with Next.js. This blog uses GitHub as a CMS, storing all posts as Markdown files directly in the repository.

## Key Features

- Posts are stored as Markdown files in the GitHub repository
- The admin interface allows creating new posts without authentication
- Posts are published via the GitHub REST API
- The blog is statically generated using Next.js SSG

## How It Works

1. Write your post in the admin interface
2. Click "Publish" to commit the post to the GitHub repository
3. Trigger a new deployment on Vercel
4. Next.js builds static pages from the Markdown files
5. Readers enjoy your new content!

That's it! Enjoy your new blog powered by GitHub and Next.js.
