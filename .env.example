# GitHub API configuration
# Note: In the actual implementation, we've hardcoded these values as requested in the PRD
# but in a real-world scenario, you would use environment variables like these:
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your_github_username
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=github-blog-mvp
GITHUB_FILE_PATH=_posts
